# Introduction

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. We use @citeR and @rohan.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-data....

# Data {#sec-data}

Some of our data is of penguins (@fig-bills), from @palmerpenguins.

```{r}
hate_crime_analysis_data <- read_csv("data/analysis_data/hate_crime_analysis_data.csv")

#| label: Monthly Hate Crimes in Toronto from 2018-2023
#| fig-cap: Number of reported hate crimes from month to month, labels are quarterly due to space.
#| echo: false


# Extract year and month from the 'occurrence_date' column
hate_crime_analysis_data <- hate_crime_analysis_data %>%
  mutate(year_month = floor_date(occurrence_date, "month"))

# Group by year and month, then count observations
monthly_counts <- hate_crime_analysis_data %>%
  group_by(year_month) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

# Plot the number of observations per month, with x-axis labels every quarter
ggplot(monthly_counts, aes(x = year_month, y = count)) +
  geom_line() +   # Use line plot to show trends over time
  geom_point() +  # Add points for better visualization
  labs(title = "Hate Crime Incidents in Toronto by Month",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Number of Reported Hate Crimes") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %Y", date_breaks = "3 months") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  annotate("text", x = as.Date("2023-01-01"), y = max(monthly_counts$count), 
           label = "Footnote: Data is plotted monthly, but labelled quarterly due to space", 
           hjust = 0, vjust = 1, size = 3.5, color = "")
```

```

As we can see, 

And also planes (@fig-planes). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work well once you have enough text.)

Talk way more about it.

# Discussion

## First discussion point {#sec-first-point}

If my paper were 10 pages, then should be be at least 2.5 pages. The discussion is a chance to show off what you know and what you learnt from all this.
